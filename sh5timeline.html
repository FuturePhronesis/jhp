                mother. Now his mother wrapped him in a towel, carried him into a rosy room that was filled with
                sunshine. She unwrapped him, laid him on the tickling towel, powdered him between his legs, joked
                with him, patted his little jelly belly. Her palm on his little jelly belly made potching sounds.
                <br>Billy gurgled and cooed."</p>

                <br>Little Billy was terrified, because his father had said Billy was going to learn to swing by the

                    with his mother and father on Bright Angel Point, at the rim of the Grand Canyon. The little human family
                    was staring at the floor of the canyon, one mile straight down.
                    <br> 'Well—' said Billy's father, manfully kicking a pebble into space, 'there it <em>is</em>.' They
                    had come to this famous place by automobile. They had had seven blowouts on the way.
                    <br>'It was worth the trip,' said Billy's mother raptly. 'Oh, God—was it ever <em>worth</em> it.'
                    <br>Billy hated the canyon. He was sure that he was going to fall in. His mother touched him, and he wet
                    his pants."</p>

                was never even issued a steel helmet and combat boots. This was in December of 1944, during the last
