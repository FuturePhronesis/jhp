                    sunshine. She unwrapped him, laid him on the tickling towel, powdered him between his legs, joked
                    with him, patted his little jelly belly. Her palm on his little jelly belly made potching sounds.
                    <br><br>Billy gurgled and cooed.

                    with his hairy father at the Ilium Y.M.C.A. He smelled chlorine from the swimming pool next door,
                        heard the springboard boom.
                    <br><br>Little Billy was terrified, because his father had said Billy was going to learn to swing by the
                    method of sink-or-swim. His father was going to throw Billy into the deep end, and Billy was going
                        to damn well swim.

                    Billy was flung back into his childhood. He was twelve years old, quaking as he stood
                    with his mother and father on Bright Angel Point, at the rim of the Grand Canyon. The little human
                        family was staring at the floor of the canyon, one mile straight down.
                    <br><br>'Well—' said Billy's father, manfully kicking a pebble into space, 'there it <em>is</em>.' They
                        had come to this famous place by automobile. They had had seven blowouts on the way.
                    <br><br>'It was worth the trip,' said Billy's mother raptly. 'Oh, God—was it ever <em>worth</em> it.'
                    <br><br>Billy hated the canyon. He was sure that he was going to fall in. His mother touched him, and he
                        wet his pants.

                    assist, was never even issued a steel helmet and combat boots. This was in December of
                    1944, during the last mighty German attack of the war.

                    important wires in it. Weary was going to break that tube.
                    <br><br>But then Weary saw that he had an audience. Five German soldiers and a police dog on a leash
                    were looking down into the bed of the creek. The soldiers' blue eyes were filled with a bleary
                    civilian curiosity as to why one American would try to murder another one so far from home,
                    and why the victim should laugh.

                    The parade pranced, staggered and reeled to the gate of the Dresden slaughterhouse, and then it
                    went inside. The slaughterhouse wasn't a busy place any more. Almost all the hooved animals in
                    animals in Germany had been killed and eaten and excreted by human beings, mostly soldiers. So
                    it goes.
                    <br><br>The Americans were taken to the fifth building inside the gate. It was a one-story cement-block
                    cube with sliding doors in front and back. It had been built as a shelter for pigs about to be
                    butchered. Now it was going to serve as a home away from home for one hundred American prisoners
                    of war. There were bunks in there, and two potbellied stoves and a water tap. Behind it was a
                    latrine, which was a one-rail fence with buckets under it.
                    <br><br>There was a big number over the door of the building. The number was <em>five</em>. Before
                    the Americans could go inside, their only English-speaking guard told them to memorize their simple
                    address, in case they got lost int he big city. Their address was this: 'Schlachthof-funf.'
                    <em>Schlachthof</em> meant <em>slaughterhouse</em>. <em>Funf</em> was good old <em>five</em>.

                    He was down in the meat locker on the night that Dresden was destroyed. There were sounds like giant
                    footsteps above. Those were sticks of high-explosive bombs. The giants walked and walked. The meat
                    locker was a very safe shelter. All that happened down there was an occasional shower of calcimine.
                    The Americans and four of their guards and a few dressed carcasses were down there, and nobody else.
                    The rest of the guards had, before the raid began, gone to the comforts of their own homes in Dresden.
                    They wer all being killed with their families.
                    <br><br>So it goes.
                    <br><br>The girls that Billy had seen naked were all being killed, too, in a much shallower shelter
                    in another part of the stockyards.
                    <br><br>So it goes.
                    <br><br>A guard would go to the head of the stairs every so often to see what it was like outside,
                    then he would come down and whisper to the other guards. There was a fire-storm ou there. Dresden
                    was one big flame. The one flame ate everything organic, everything that would burn.
                    <br><br>It wasn't safe to come out of the shelter until noon the next day. When the Americans and
                    their guards did come out, the sky was black with smoke. The sun was an angry little pinhead. Dresden
                    was like the moon now, nothing but minerals. The stones were hot. Everybody else in the neighborhood
                    was dead.

                    looking for souvenirs. Later on in life, the Tralfamadorians would advise Billy to concentrate on
                    the happy moments of his life, and to ignore the unhappy ones—to star only at pretty things as
                    eternity failed to go by. If this sort of selectivity had been possible fo Billy, he might have
                    chosen as his happiest moment his sun-drenched snooze in the back of the wagon.

                    The barbershop quartet on the airplane was singing 'Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nelly,' when the
                    plane smacked into the top of Sugarbush Mountain in Vermont. Everybody was killed but Billy and
                    the copilot. So it goes.

                <blockquote>
                    When she arrived at the hospital, people rushed to the windows to see what all the noise was. The
                    Cadillac, with both mufflers gone, sounded like a heavy bomber coming in on a wing and a prayer.
                    Valencia turned off the engine, but then she slumped against the steering wheel, and the horn
                    brayed steadily. A doctor and a nurse ran out to find out what the trouble was. Poor Valencia
                    was unconscious, overcome by carbon monoxide. She was a heavenly azure. <br><br>On hour later she
                    was dead. So it goes.

                    And then Billy was allowed to speak. Off he went, in that beautifully trained voice of his,
                    telling about the flying saucers and Montana Wildhack and so on.
                    <br><br>He was gently expelled from the studio during a commercial.

                    'No, no,' says Billy serenely. 'It is time for you to go home to your wives and children, and it
                    is time for me to be dead for a little while—and then live again.' At that moment, Billy's high
                    forehead is in the cross hairs of a high-powered laser gun. It is aimed at him from the darkened
                    press box. In the next moment, Billy Pilgrim is dead. So it goes.
                    <br><br>So Billy experiences death for a while. It is simply violet light and a hum. There isn't
                    anybody else there. Not even Billy Pilgrim is there.
